      <p>It has never been easy for me to stick with one hobby or interest. So,
        throughout my childhood, I bounced from one hobby to the next with
        an "obsessive" behavior, according to my parents and peers. Most
        say mastering requires specialization,
        however, I disagree. Although I was unaware of how the knowledge I
        gained from each endeavor would impact me in the future, I soon learned
        that this breadth of knowledge would allow me to make connections between
        ideas that were not obvious to
        those around me. After I began college, I discovered the one thing that
        all of my interests had in common: creating. This realization led me to
        find my true passion in the field of computer engineering, where I could
        combine my love for art and
        design with mathematics to create valuable solutions for everyday problems.
        I believe my obsessive nature and my diverse background will benefit me
        in this constantly evolving field, and, most importantly, I am eager to
        learn and create new relationships along the way. </p>
